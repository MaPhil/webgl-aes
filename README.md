webgl-aes
=========

An WebGL-based AES implementation that can be several times faster than pure JavaScript AES implementation, and can be supported in various browsers cross multiple platforms.


Anyone who's interesting can first take a test by deploying the source in a web server then view benchmark.html in a browser that supports WebGL(almost all browsers from major vendors does, or can be enabled by plugins) and benchmark the performance of the implementation on your machine.
